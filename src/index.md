# Overview

Welcome! For the Kitty Eclipse project, we are using the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit.

## Operating System

This device is currently running [Jetpack 4.6.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-462). It uses [Jetson Linux R32.7.?](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra-r3272), which is based on [Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)](https://ubuntu.com/18-04). This version has reached the end of support, but unfortunately, NVIDIA has not released any further updates for this device, so we need to use an operating system that hasn't been updated for the past two years.
